<h1>The Cold War and Word Embeddings: Exploring Gender in the FRUS Series, 1945-1960</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This repository contains the elements of a case study that demonstrates some capabilities of word vector models. This case study is tracked through a series of Jupyter Notebooks that contain the following elements: <br>

Introduction <br>
Literature Review <br> 
Methods and Code  <br>
Analysis <br>
Conclusion <br>
Bibliography and Further Reading <br>

These notebooks use R to perform the code. <br>
Please fork the repository for your own use and to follow along.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
To begin understanding the case study, please see the Notebook entitled “Introduction”. This file outlines the scope and framework of this study. Please see this file for further direction based on your own research interests. 

For direct access to the code portion, please see the folder on “Methods and Code”. Within this file you will find the required materials for completing a word vector analysis, including a .ipynb file by the same name with the code and commentary. 

<h2>Uses</h2>
This project is intended for scholars new to text analysis to understand the capabilities of word vector analysis and follow along with a step-by-step example. This project is also intended to act as a case study for scholars interested in the digital humanities. 

<h2>Credit</h2>
This project is based on and uses code from the Women Writers Project Rmd file “introduction_word2vec” which uses the "wordVectors" package developed by Ben Schmidt and Jian Li. The file can be found here: https://github.com/NEU-DSG/wwp-public-code-share/blob/master/WordVectors/introduction_word2vec.Rmd. This code has been slightly modified to fit my corpus and research questions. This project was inspired by the “Word Vectors for the Thoughtful Humanist” institute hosted by the Women Writers Project in July 2019. This project is also reliant on the Foreign Relations of the United States series which can be found here: https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/ebooks.
